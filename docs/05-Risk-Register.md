## Risk Scoring Context
*   **Asset:** Organizational email system (inbound and outbound).
*   **Threat:** External adversary utilizing social engineering to gain initial access or commit fraud.
*   **Vulnerability:** Absent DMARC enforcement, weak SPF/DKIM configuration, and potential end-user susceptibility to authority-based social engineering.
