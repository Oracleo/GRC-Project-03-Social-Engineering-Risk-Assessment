# 4. Assumed Business Context – The "What If" Scenario

In GRC, we must assume a business context to accurately weigh the severity of an incident. This document outlines the **fictional but realistic escalation** of the phishing email, should it have succeeded.

## 4.1 Victim Profile & Target Selection
- **Targeted User:** Senior Finance Administrator / Accounts Payable Clerk.
- **Why:** Employees in financial roles frequently handle large wire transfers, invoice approvals, and payroll data. The scam's emphasis on a **$10.5 million USD** consignment was specifically designed to appeal to a senior financial target.

## 4.2 The Attack Chain (If the user had replied)
1. **Initial Contact (TA0001):** User replies directly to `mywoodforestbiz.7@gmail.com` to arrange delivery of the "funds".
2. **Information Harvesting (TA0009):** The attacker, posing as a Diplomatic Agent, requests banking details and personal identification (Passport scan/Driving license) to "facilitate the transfer".
3. **Identity Theft (TA0006 / T1110):** The attacker uses the provided PII (Name, Address, Phone, Occupation) and ID scans to open fraudulent lines of credit or initiate unauthorized financial transactions in the employee's name.
4. **Business Email Compromise (BEC) (TA0040):** Alternatively, the attacker uses the employee's compromised identity to pivot. They send a "fake invoice" to the payroll department, resulting in a $50,000 wire transfer to an external account.

## 4.3 Forensic Implications
Because the attacker utilized a **free Gmail account (`mywoodforestbiz.7@gmail.com`)** as the Reply-To address, they established a communication channel that completely bypasses corporate security logging. 
- **Shadow IT Risk:** The corporate security team would have **zero visibility** into the attacker's further communications with the victim.
- **Data Leakage:** All PII transmitted by the victim resides entirely on Google's servers, not within the corporate network's eDiscovery tools, making post-incident forensic recovery nearly impossible.

## 4.4 Conclusion on Assumed Impact
While the email itself contained no malicious links or attachments (earning it a Medium severity), the **consequences of a user replying** escalate to a **High/Critical** business impact (Identity theft, financial loss, and severe brand damage). This justifies the immediate implementation of the DMARC control.
