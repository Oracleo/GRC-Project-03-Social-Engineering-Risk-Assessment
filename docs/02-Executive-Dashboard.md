## High-Priority Action Items

1.  **P1 - DMARC Enforcement:** Configure `p=reject` and enforce strict SPF alignment on all organizational domains to prevent sender spoofing.
2.  **P1 - IOC Blocking:** Block source IP `109.202.24.52` and the compromised relay `54upr.rosreestr.ru`.
3.  **P2 - User Training:** Update security awareness modules to include "Reply-To" address mismatch detection and Advance Fee Fraud examples.
4.  **P3 - Threat Intel Integration:** Configure email gateway to quarantine messages exhibiting multiple weak signals (SPF FAIL + No DKIM + Reply-To mismatch).
