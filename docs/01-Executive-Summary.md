# 1. Executive Summary

*  **Date of Investigation:** 11 November 2025
*  **Conducted By:** Niladri Biswas
*  **Assessment Type:** Phishing Email Incident Investigation
*  **Target Asset:** Organizational Email Gateway and End-Users

## Situation Overview
A phishing email was reported by an end-user to the security team. The email was investigated to determine the nature of the attack, identify technical control failures, and establish an actionable incident response plan. The investigation uncovered a highly targeted Advance Fee Fraud (419 Scam) attempt.

## Key Findings
*   **Email Authentication Failure:** SPF validation **failed**, with no DKIM signature present and no DMARC policy enforcing a `reject` action. The email should never have reached the inbox.
*   **IOC Extraction:** The attack originated from a Russian IP (`109.202.24.52`) routed through a compromised subdomain of the legitimate Russian government entity `rosreestr.ru`.
*   **False Negative Alert:** VirusTotal showed **0/93 vendor detections** for the sender IP. This proves that automated tools alone are insufficient—manual GRC analysis was critical to classifying this incident as malicious.

## Strategic Recommendations
1.  **DMARC Enforcement (Immediate):** Configure DMARC to `p=reject` for all organizational domains to prevent sender spoofing.
2.  **SPF/DKIM Hardening:** Implement strict SPF quarantine rules on the email gateway and ensure DKIM signatures are applied to all outbound mail.
3.  **User Awareness:** Update employee security training to include identifying "Reply-To" address mismatches and spoofing techniques.
4.  **IOC Blocking:** Block the sender IP and compromised relay subdomain at the perimeter firewall and email gateway.

## Conclusion
This incident represents a **control failure** in the email authentication layer rather than a zero-day exploit. A single DMARC policy update would have completely neutralized this threat. Immediate action is required to fortify the email infrastructure against future phishing attempts.
